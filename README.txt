We selected to complete the standard Mini Amazon as our project. Our team name is JELAY. Since our last milestone, we have established lines of communication via a group chat, a Slack, and GitHub repo. We met before the Discussion on 9/13 to discuss if we would like to pursue the standard or open project option. We have also now established an ongoing meeting on Sundays at noon.
